# MarkdownWidget Implementation Solution

## Problem
The `markdown_widget` Flutter package (v2.3.2+6) was failing to render markdown content in our story reader, showing either blank pages or raw markdown text with decorations like `**bold**` and `#` headers.

## Root Cause
The MarkdownWidget was encountering layout constraints issues:
- "Vertical viewport was given unbounded height" errors
- Assertion failures in Flutter's rendering system
- The widget was receiving data correctly but failing to render due to layout constraints

## Solution
Wrap MarkdownWidget in proper layout constraints:

```dart
return Column(
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: [
    MarkdownWidget(
      data: fullText,
      config: isDark ? MarkdownConfig.darkConfig : MarkdownConfig.defaultConfig,
      shrinkWrap: true,
    ),
  ],
);
```

### Key Elements:
1. **shrinkWrap: true** - Tells MarkdownWidget to only take the space it needs
2. **Column with mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min** - Provides bounded height constraints
3. **Built-in theme configs** - Use `MarkdownConfig.darkConfig` and `MarkdownConfig.defaultConfig` rather than custom styling

## Theme Integration
The solution properly integrates with our light/dark theme system:
```dart
final isDark = Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark;
config: isDark ? MarkdownConfig.darkConfig : MarkdownConfig.defaultConfig
```

## Result
- Proper markdown rendering with **bold**, *italic*, `# headers`, `> blockquotes`
- Automatic theme switching between light and dark modes  
- No more layout constraint errors
- Text is fully visible and properly formatted

## Implementation Location
- File: `lib/widgets/streaming_story_text.dart`
- Used in: Story reader pages for displaying narrative content
- Status: Working âœ…

## Notes for Future
- The `markdown_widget` library's API was initially confusing due to incorrect parameter usage
- Always use the built-in `darkConfig` and `defaultConfig` rather than trying to create custom configurations
- Layout constraints are critical for this widget - always wrap in bounded containers
