# Offline Functionality Fixes

## Overview
Major overhaul of the app's loading and offline-first functionality. Fixed multiple layers of broken loading states, type casting issues, and implemented proper API connectivity tracking.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **LinkedMap Type Casting Errors**
**Problem**: Hive storage was returning `LinkedMap<dynamic, dynamic>` objects that couldn't be cast to `Map<String, dynamic>`. This broke all catalog and data loading from cache.

**Solution**:
- Fixed type casting in `state_manager.dart`, `library_catalog.dart`, and `genre_row.dart`
- Added safe casting: `Map<String, dynamic>.from(rawData)` for LinkedMap objects
- **Root Cause**: Hive's object graph storage creates LinkedMaps instead of regular Maps

### 2. **Storage Architecture Change**
**Problem**: Complex object graph storage was fundamentally broken and hard to debug.

**Solution**:
- **Changed from object graph storage to JSON string caching**
- `saveCatalog()`: Now stores `jsonEncode(catalogData)`
- `getCatalog()`: Parses with `jsonDecode(catalogJsonString)`
- Works like proper HTTP cache - simple and reliable

### 3. **Multiple Error Handling Layers**
**Problem**: 3+ different error screens were stacked on top of each other, hiding actual functionality.

**Removed**:
- "Unable to load catalog" error screen
- "Infiniteer" loading screen with book icon
- "Premium Interactive Fiction" fallback text
- "Loading your story library..." message

**Result**: App now shows cached content immediately instead of blocking with error states.

### 4. **Token Balance Signaling System**
**Problem**: Token balance updates weren't signaling the UI properly.

**Solution**:
- Added `ValueNotifier<int?> tokenBalanceNotifier` to StateManager
- All account data saves now call `tokenBalanceNotifier.value = tokens`
- Library screen listens to notifier for instant UI updates
- **No more polling or delays** - pure event-driven updates

## API Connectivity Tracking

### 5. **Global Connection Status Service**
**Problem**: App showed "Connected" even when all APIs were down.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `ConnectivityService` to track actual API success/failure
- **Any successful API call (200-299)** → `markConnected()`
- **Any API failure (400-500, timeouts, network errors)** → `markDisconnected()`
- Added `ClientException: Failed to fetch` to network error detection

### 6. **UI Status Integration**
- **Connected**: Blue info icon, "Connected"
- **Disconnected**: Orange error icon, "Service issue with your network or Infiniteer"
- Info button appears on **all base page headers** (Library, Story Reader, Purchase)
- Fixed text wrapping in info modal
- Title changed to "Infiniteer App Info"

## Story Reader UI Improvements

### 7. **AppBar Consolidation**
**Problem**: Story turn pages had no header, custom navigation was scattered.

**Solution**:
- Added proper AppBar to turn pages with format: `"Story Title (T/N)"`
- **Moved to AppBar**: Token balance button, settings (book icon), info button
- **Removed**: Custom header row, duplicate back button, old title display
- Settings icon changed from gear → book icon

## Offline-First Architecture

### 8. **Loading Process Flow**
```
1. App starts → Shows cached data immediately
2. Background API calls → Update cache + signal UI
3. API success → markConnected() + refresh UI
4. API failure → markDisconnected() + keep cached data
```

### 9. **Happy Path & Offline Scenarios**
- ✅ **Fresh data**: Loads and caches properly
- ✅ **Services down**: App works from cache with no loading spinners
- ✅ **Cover images**: 14-day cache (30-day max)
- ✅ **Error states**: Clean error icons instead of broken loading screens

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `lib/services/state_manager.dart` - JSON storage + signaling
- `lib/services/connectivity_service.dart` - API status tracking
- `lib/services/secure_api_service.dart` - Connection status calls
- `lib/models/catalog/*.dart` - LinkedMap type fixes
- `lib/screens/library_screen.dart` - Removed error layers
- `lib/screens/story_reader_screen.dart` - AppBar consolidation
- `lib/screens/info_modal_screen.dart` - Text wrapping + title

### Performance Impact
- **Faster loading**: Immediate cache rendering
- **Better UX**: No blocking loading screens
- **Cleaner code**: JSON storage vs complex object graphs
- **Reliable offline**: Proper cache utilization

## Result
The app is now truly offline-first with bulletproof loading functionality. Users see cached content instantly and receive real-time connectivity status without any blocking UI states.
