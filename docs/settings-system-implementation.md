# Settings System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive settings system was implemented for the Flutter story reader app, providing users with convenient story management and theme control options.

## Features Implemented

### üéØ Header Enhancement
- **Story Title Display**: Headers now show "Story Title (Turn N)" format instead of just "Turn N"
- **Example**: "White Room (Turn 1)", "Colossal (Turn 1)"

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Modal
- **Gear Icon**: Added to upper right of all story page headers
- **Translucent Overlay**: Modal with three organized sections:

#### 1. Appearance Section
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Seamless theme switching
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes apply immediately

#### 2. Turn Management Section  
- **Delete Last Turn**: Remove the most recent turn with turn number display
- **Status-aware**: Greyed out when story status is not "ready"
- **Subtitle**: Shows "Remove turn N" or "No turns to delete"

#### 3. Playthrough Management Section
- **Delete Entire Playthrough**: Complete story progress reset
- **Status-aware**: Greyed out when story status is not "ready"  
- **Subtitle**: Clear warning about data loss

### üîí Safety Features
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: "Are you sure?" prompts for all destructive actions
- **Status Checks**: Operations only available when story is in "ready" state
- **Success Feedback**: SnackBar notifications for completed actions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with user feedback

## Technical Architecture

### Clean Separation of Concerns
```
UI Layer: StorySettingsOverlay (widgets/story_settings_overlay.dart)
Logic Layer: StoryStorageManager (services/story_storage_manager.dart)
```

### Storage Management
- **Dual Storage Support**: Works with both chunked and legacy storage systems
- **Atomic Operations**: Safe deletion with proper cleanup
- **State Consistency**: Automatic reload after changes

### Key Methods Added
```dart
// StateManager additions
deleteTurn(storyId, playthroughId, turnNumber)
deleteAllTurns(storyId, playthroughId)  
deletePlaythroughMetadata(storyId, playthroughId)
deleteCompleteStoryState(storyId)

// StoryPlaythrough model
copyWith({...}) // For immutable updates
```

## Bug Fixes Included

### Initial API Save Issue
- **Problem**: First turn from GET `/play/{storyId}` wasn't being saved to chunked storage
- **Solution**: Modified story initialization to save to both legacy and chunked storage
- **Result**: Consistent storage across all systems

### Input Text Restoration
- **Problem**: After connection errors, "go back" cleared user input
- **Solution**: Restore `metadata.userInput` to input controller on go back
- **Result**: Users don't lose their typed input after errors

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `lib/widgets/story_settings_overlay.dart` - Settings UI component
- `lib/services/story_storage_manager.dart` - Storage manipulation logic

### Modified Files
- `lib/screens/story_reader_screen.dart` - Added gear icon and settings integration
- `lib/services/state_manager.dart` - Added deletion methods
- `lib/models/turn_data.dart` - Added copyWith method to StoryPlaythrough

## Usage
1. Navigate to any story turn page
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon in the upper right
3. Choose desired action from the three sections
4. Confirm destructive actions when prompted
5. Observe success notifications and updated state

## Development Notes
- All UI text is user-friendly and descriptive
- Status-dependent enabling prevents data corruption
- Proper error boundaries ensure app stability
- Theme changes persist across app sessions
- Settings modal is dismissible via background tap or close button

## Testing Verified
- ‚úÖ Theme toggle functionality
- ‚úÖ Turn deletion with proper cleanup
- ‚úÖ Playthrough deletion with complete reset
- ‚úÖ Status-based option enabling/disabling
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog flows
- ‚úÖ Success notification display
- ‚úÖ State reload after operations
- ‚úÖ Header title format display

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly settings system that enhances the story reading experience while maintaining data safety and system reliability.
